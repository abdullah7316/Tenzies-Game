# Running the React Website

If you want to run the React website from its source code hosted on GitHub, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites
1. **Git**: Ensure that you have Git installed on your computer. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

2. **Node.js and npm**: You'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to install and manage project dependencies. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
```

Replace `yourusername` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and the name of your repository.

## Navigate to the Project Directory
Change into the project directory by using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd your-repo-name
```

## Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn. Run one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

or

```bash
yarn install
```

This will download and install all the necessary packages and libraries defined in the `package.json` file.

## Start the Development Server
After installing the dependencies, start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This command will build and serve your React application locally. It should automatically open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` where you can see your website.

## Play the Game
Once the development server is running, you can interact with your Tenzies game in your web browser. Play the game, check your best score, total rolls, and game duration!

## Stopping the Development Server
To stop the development server, simply press `Ctrl + C` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Customization
Feel free to customize and enhance the website by modifying the React source code in your local project directory. You can also make improvements and push changes back to your GitHub repository for others to see and use.

That's it! You've successfully cloned, installed, and run your React website from the source code on GitHub. Enjoy your game, and happy coding!
