# Tenzies-Game

## Introduction
Hello, I'm Abdullah Rahim, a frontend developer with expertise in React.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this Tenzies game as part of a course project and added additional functionality to enhance the gaming experience.

## About the Game

### Features

- Track your best score, total rolls, and game duration.
- Automatically save your best score to local storage for future reference.
- Enjoy a clean and responsive user interface.
